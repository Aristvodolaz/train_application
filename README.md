# Individual Training App

This is an Android app for individual training with user authentication using Firebase. The app allows users to register, log in, and save their profile information (such as name and email). The app also supports navigation between the authentication screen and the main screen using Jetpack Navigation. The project uses **Hilt** for dependency injection, **Firebase Authentication** for login and registration, **Firebase Realtime Database** for storing user data, and **Jetpack Compose** for UI.

## Features
